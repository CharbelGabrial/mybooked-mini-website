00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.679
It took seeing it with my own eyes to

2
00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:05.520
realize that the world we live in

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.800
is absolutely incredible it now

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.719

the forests the oceans the landscapes

17
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.920
after a couple of months of traveling my

18
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.760
interest in visiting wild and remote

19
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.119
places grew

20
00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:12.960
i walked with nomads through the sahara

21
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.680
desert visited the arctic circle

22
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.439
and the more people i met during these

23
00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:21.680
travels the more stories i craved

24
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.320
so when i got invited to visit mongolia

25
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.479
one of the wildest and remote places on

26
00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:26.960

landscapes with huge blue youth skies

31
00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.520
and a sense of incredible space when

32
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.079
driving through mongolia

33
00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.240
but there is an entire culture of warm

guest at any time

36
00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.000
it was at times like this when i

37
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.680
realized the most that from people

38
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.280
living such simple lives

39
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.840

climbed one of the most dangerous

â™ª I'm slowly drifting to You â™ª

57
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.080
a lot of times i get asked how i got so

58
00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.280
lucky

59
00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.120

are my parents rich however the truth is

62
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.160
rather different and quite simple

63
00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.080
two years ago i made the decision to

64
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.000
start chasing my dreams and to never

65
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.120
look back

66
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.240
to not have a plan it was not easy and i

67
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.160
had many doubts

68
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.320
i worked many little jobs to save up and

69
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.639
eventually i started traveling

70
00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.560
even though the journey wasn't easy i

71
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.560
never looked back

72
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.320
and deep down i believed that if there's

73
00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.400
something you're truly passionate about

74
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.560
nothing should stop you and that if you

75
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.160
keep chasing your dreams
